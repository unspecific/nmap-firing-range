    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We collect only the essentials: your courage, your curiosity, and maybe your IP address. We promise not to sell any of it‚Äîunless there's a bidding war.</p>

    <h2>2. Cookies</h2>
    <p>Yes, we use cookies üç™. They are delicious default session cookies. Unfortunately, we can't bake you a real one via HTTP.</p>

    <h2>3. Sharing Info</h2>
    <p>We might share anonymized data with our pet cicada choir for performance reviews. Otherwise, your exploits stay between you and the lab.</p>

    <h2>4. Liability</h2>
    <p>By using the Nmap Firing Range, you agree that any explosions of brilliance are your own fault, and any explosions of servers are not our responsibility.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to change this policy at any time, especially after our lawyer naps. Check back if you care, or don't‚Äîyour call.</p>
